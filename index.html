     <h1> All About Ducks </h1> </div> </section>
  
    <section id="About"> 
    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> I like ducklings because they have a playful, adorable nature. A duck is a bird also called waterfowl because they live near places where there are ponds, streams, and rivers. They have a broad blunt bill, with black eyes. They have a short stubby tail. They have short legs with webbed feet for swimming. They have 3 toes with three on the front, and one sticking out of the back of their leg. They will either sleep on their nest, or they can even just snooze on the grass. Their diet consists of aquatic vegetation such as pond weed, along with seeds, insects, worms, small water snails and amphibians. I hope I will get a pet duckling on day.</p> </section>
  
    <section id="Life Span/Growth">
    <h3> Life Span/Growth </h3>
    <p> Ducks can live from 5-10 years depending on care. <br> </p> 
    <p class="Headings"> MATING </p>
    <p> It all starts with two ducks of the opposite gender. Then they display courtship. There are many ways of doing this depending on the species. Some may head pump, which is bobbing their heads up and down. Some may do the tail-up-head-up, where they stick their heads and tails in the air. Some may thrust their head back onto their backs. They may even chase each other in the water. But commonly, it has something to do with the head. Then they will mate aftarward. Drakes(A male duck) will be aggressive in order to mate with females. The female will avoid all other males and only have babies with the male of her choosing.</p> 
    <p class="Headings">EGGS</p>
<p> The female will lay eggs during mid-March until early July. Each of her clutches will have about 10 eggs. She will lay 1-2 eggs each day until the clutch is complete. Then she and her mate will incubate the eggs, which will take about a month. Throughout this time, the mother will regularly turn her eggs. And when she gets up for breaks, the eggs will roll a bit anyway. During the incubation procces, the embryo(the developing duckling.) will grow, and will get all its nutriants from the egg yolk. Around day 1-2, the embryo cells are coming together to form a back bone. Its body structure will form, and its heart will start beating. A head, tail, and eyes will form. From that embryo, a complicated network of branching blood vessels will grow all throughout the yolk. These blood vessels will carry neccisarry nutrients for the growth of the embryo. slowly during the more later days of incubation, their body features will grow. Beak, wings, limbs, claws, skin, hairs. Until the hatching day. By then they have soaked up all the yolk and egg white and is ready to hatch. They have a stub on their bill called the eggs tooth used to break out of their egg. They first make a pip hole which is a small hole in the egg made by them in order to take their first breath outside the egg. After this, they slowly turn around inside the egg cracking the whole top off. This hatching procces takes around 24 hours. After they hatch, their egg tooth falls off. Usually, ducklings will imprint on their mothers right after hatching. This is when they psychologically recognize the ducks as their parents, and will look up to them. If in this case a human hatches them in an incubator, then the ducklings will imprint on the human.
  <p class="Headings"> GROWTH </p>
    <p> The duckling parents are very protective from day one. After laying eggs, the mother keeps her eggs warm while the father stands guard in front of the nest. They will defend and attack anything that will come near or try to harm them. Even humans! With in the first day, the ducklings are ready to explore and learn. They go into the water. They borrow their mothers oil from her oil glands. This will help them to stay afloat in water. When they grow up, they will have their own oil glands. They are taught which foods to eat, and which to avoid. Sometimes they eat grit, which is little sand and pebble peices which help to break down food in their gizzard. In about a month they will reach their full size and grown most of their adult feathers. After 2 months they will be able ot fly. And after a year they will start the life cycle all over again. </p>

      <h4> Pet Care </h4>
  <p class="Headings"> EGGS </p> 
<p> First you need an incubator. You can either make one, or buy one. You can use a plastic box with some water, and a source of heat. But be sure that the humidity and temp is pretty consistant, and the incubator is as hot and as humid as instructed below. You have to get fertilized eggs. Best option is to pick up the eggs from a local farm. delivery might damage the eggs and something could go wrong. If the eggs are dirty, DO NOT WASH THEM. This will remove the protective outer coating and the egg will be prone to disease and bacteria. Just gently scratch and scrape them off. In about a week after laying, an eggs fertility will start to decline. The earlier layed the better. To store eggs for incubation, you have to keep them in a cool area, with about 60°F. Keep the eggs pointy side down at a 45° angle. if you cant manage 45° you can do 0° on its side. Rotate them 180° from side to side several times a day until you have enough eggs for incubation. Next draw a symbol on the side of the egg to keep track of turning. If your incubator already has an egg turner, then you dont need to do this manually. Heat up the incubator to 98°F for an hour. Then place the eggs in the incubator, and turn the temperature to 99.5°F. Embryonic development can start when they temp is around 80-90°F but we need 99 to ensure a proper healthy chick. Any hotter than 100°F and the embryo might burn to death. The pointy side of the egg needs to be pointing 45° downward. This is important because the wide round part of the egg has the "air sac". If the pointy side is facing up, then there will be pressure on the air sac due to the gravity. Put the incubator in a place out of direct sunlight or away from the cold drafty window. The temperature and humidity in the incubator should be around 99.5°F and 70% humidity for the 1st 25 days. You want to turn the eggs 5 times a day. But the more you turn them, the better. You have to turn them at least 3 times, but 5 times is better, and recomended. Be sure to turn them an odd number of times. This will ensure that the egg rests on the opposite side each night. You do not neccisarily need to turn the ggs during the night, but then again, the more the better. This will prevent the developing embryo from sticking to the sides of the egg shell because the yolk/embryo tends to float up to the surface of the egg white, sticking to the roof of the egg. (Embryo is the developing baby bird inside the egg). You should also turn the egg 1 way 180°, and then 180° the other way. If you keep rotating in one way, then the membrane under the egg shell can tear.  By week 1 of incubating, you should see some veins spreading from a pink bulge in the middle of the egg. Candeling is basically shining a light through an egg in the dark to see if it has life inside. You can do this to check the growth on your eggs. If there is anything fishy, or if you see dark and blotchy spots inside the egg during candeling, either seperate that one from the rest, or throw it out for the saftey of the rest of the eggs. This is because bacteria can get into one of your eggs, and then infect and kill the embryo. Then the egg can explode and infect the other eggs. Starting on day 10, you should cool and mist the eggs. This will imitate the mother duck leaving the nest for a swim, then coming back to her nest. This increases hatching rates since it is done in nature. To do this, leave the incubator lid open for 30 minutes, then gently mist the eggs with a spray bottle with lukewarm water. Keep cooling, misting, and turning eggs until day 26. After this stop. The humidity should be increased to 80% in the incubator for the last 3 days. This is to help them hatch out of the egg. If you are using an automatic egg turner rack, then on the last 3 days, you should remove the racks from the incubator and place the eggs on the bottom of the incubator. You should place a paper towel underneath the eggs when putting them on the bottom. The eggs should not be moved now because they will move into hatching position. The main idea is to make it safe for when the ducklings hatch out of the eggs. On day 28, you should hear peeping from inside eggs, and you should see a cracked hole forming on the egg. This peeping is the way the ducklings imprint on the mother. This hatching procces can take up to more than a day, so be patient! Dont help them come out of the egg. This will disrupt the nataral hatching procces. It could also hurt the chick that is hatching. This is because as they are hatching, they will turn and twist to spin all around inside the egg, to open the lid of the egg. This will twist the umbilical chord, and since it takes so long, the umbilical chord will natarally shrivel up and disconnect. If you help the duckling, then you could damage the unbilical chord causing it to bleed a lot. If the chick is having trouble hatching out of the egg, and no proggress is made in 12 hours, you can turn up the humidity, or wrap that egg in a damp paper towel for an hour. This will help moisturize the egg in order to soften the shell to make it easier to hatch out. After hatching, they will be wet and tired. Because hatching is a lot of work for them. They will probably lay down and rest for some time. Leave the newly hatched ducklings in the incubator until they are fluffy, and up and running. If there are any unhatched eggs, then you can leave them in the incubator for a few more days in the same conditions. You can also candle them to determine life. You might see a slight pumping, and the round part of the egg should be emty and clear. The rest of the egg should be taken up by a dark mass. That is the duckling. During candeling, if the whole egg is a blurry, yellowish-orange shade, then that probably means that egg has no life.  </p> 
       
       <p class="Headings"> DUCKLINGS </p> 
       <p> If you are raising ducklings, you need to keep them in a brooder box. Keep in mind they are VERY messy. Especially when they are young. Infact, most of the mess is created by the food and water rather than their poop! So it is important for them to be clean. Even after they grow up. Make sure this brooder box is away from other pets, or little kids for safety. This will make a similar warm enviroment under the mother duck. Line the bottom of the box with something that is comfortable for the ducklings, and can soak up well. You can take a box and line it with insulation. Make sure there is enough ventilation like a room. Then you need a source of heat to fill the box with wamrth. You can use a heat lamp to warm up the brooder. make sure the heat is on one side, or in a corner so the ducklings can go near and far away from the heat as they like. You can also keep a heated brooder in the box for them to sit under. This is a raised platform which produces heat like the underbelly of a mother duck. They will need extra heat, because their yellow ducklings fuzz is not enough. When your putting them in the brooder, gently nudge their head near the food and water, to teach them where the food and water is. Make sure that they are eating with in 3 days. As they grow up, you can slowly decline the temperature to make them get used to the normal temperature. They should be kept at 90°F for the first week. Then at 85°F for the nest week, then drop the temperature 5°F each week until they are fully feathered. They havent grown their warm adult downy feathers. They will not be needed to be fed food/water for the first few days after hatching since the egg yolk can provide some nutrients for the ducklings. Though you can keep food and water in there so that who ever is ready, they can start eating when ever they are ready. You can make some easy simple feeders for them. For food you can buy some non-medicated duckling feed. After a few days, you can introduce them to a few veggies too. You can also mix some grains into their feed like oats, rice, and pasta. You might want to also give them a bowl of grit/sand. They will eat this, and it will help them in their digestion. You can also give them some protein. This ensures a strong boost in a ducks early life. 20% protein for the first few weeks. Niacin is also suggested. Especially in ducklings, niacin is important for ducklings when they are growing. It helps them convert food into energy. Make sure all the food is cut up or ground into swallowable peices, because ducks cant exactly "chew" their food with their flat bill. They may sometimes swish some water around with the food in their bill to help them eat the food. You can have a raised platform in your brooder for the food and water because they will spill and make a mess. You can introduce the ducklings to swimming in water after they are a few days old. They also love when you throw some cut up veggies in their pool. They love snacking while swimming. You can do this with all aged ducks. But you have to be carful of water. You shouldnt leave a duckling swimming alone unnattended. They can get too cold if they are in the water for too long, or they may drown. You want the water level to be so that they can touch their feet to the ground. This is because their oil glands havent fully developed, so it will be harder for them to float in the water. you can leave a small, shallow bowl in the brooder for them to splash around in. But for the first few days, keep the water level so that they can dunk their head in the water. This is important for their hygine. They will dunk their heads in water several times a day to keep their bill, nose, and eyes clean. After they are all grown up then they can swim around in the water all day no problem. </p>
       
     <p class="Headings"> DUCKS </p>
<p> Keep in mind that live poultry like ducks, chickens, and turkeys can carry salmonella. This is dangerous for very young kids, and very old people because their imune systems are still weak. So be sure to wash your hands after you handle live poultry. Remember that ducks need to live outside exept if they are young. They can cometimes visit inside but they are more suited for the outdoors. They are not a house pet. Telling a ducks gender from a young age is hard. So when they grow up, you can tell the diffence. Most accurately you can tell their gender by their voices. Female ducks have a more strong bold QUACK! But the males have a more hoarse throaty raspy growl. Ducks are social animals, so keeping only 1 would not be a good idea. They can get depressed just like us, so it is best to have at least 2 ducks. And if there are more males than females, then the males will fight over the females. This can get pretty rough, and the female(s) will likely get harassed. It is always better to have less males than females in your flock. Domestic ducks usually cant fly, but some species can. Ducks can eat a wide variety of food. Since they only have a bill, it will be hard for them to chew their food. They can eat a few fruits with out pits. But they can not eat citrus fruit. They can eat grains like cooked rice, quinoa, and pasta. They can also eat simple cereal or snacks. As long as they don't contain salt, sugar, or any oil. They can eat lots of vegetables. They can has as much vegetable as they want. They can also eat worms, slugs, and can be a nataral pest clearer for your plants. Worms and mealworm are a great nataral treat. Live or dried, they love it! They can also eat duck pellets. Ducks need a LOT of water. After all they are waterfowl. They need fresh drinking water, and lots of water in a large tub for swimming. Ducks can live in tempertures above 20°F. They can live outside. In the summer, they need even more water to stay cool. If you see a duck breathing through its bill, and if it is holding its wings away from its body, then it is probably too hot for it. imediatly remove it from that area to a cool place with water for it to cool off. If ducks are exposed to heat for too long, they can die. On a summer day, make sure there are shady spots if they are outside. They need some cooling time under the shade to rest or take naps which they often do. This is important for them to get our of direct sunlight when ever they want. During the summer, offer more fresh wet fruits and vegetables so they can keep hydrated. At night, you can keep them outside, but be sure that they are protected well. There are many night time predators and they can snatch your duck if you are not careful. A wood box with a strong latch is a good idea for a strong shelter. Inside that box make sure to have some bedding for them to snuggle on. This helps keep their feet warm. You can also have some raised perches or platforms for them to sit on during the night for their feet to be warm. If they are hopping from one foot to the other, and are standing on one foot at a time, then that probably means their feet are cold. Make sure to have some Ventilation in their coop. Ducks do not need food and water during the night. They will be perfectly fine like us durig the whole night. But be sure they have food from sunrise to sunset. In the winter offer your ducks peanuts and corn, which will raise their body temperatures and build up some fat for the winter. Ducks are curious, so if you have any plants you dont want them to damage they should be well out of sight. And you should also keep away things that are dangerous.

     <h5> Fun Facts </h5>
       
  <p>- Day light effects the number eggs layed The more light the more legs, the less light the less eggs <br>
      - Their outer feathers are so waterproof, that they keep the fluffy underfeathers completley dry when they swim <br>
      - Each year during winter, they find a new mate to have more eggs <br>
      - Ducks have a pecking order, which is basically a hierarchy of who gets to eat food first <br>
      - Ducks stick their top half of their body in water in search of food <br>
      - They play by speed diving under water <br>
      - Baby ducks natarally know how to clean and preen themselfs <br>
      - Duck eggs are good for baking. Better than chicken eggs (cakes, cookies, bread) <br>
      - Duck eggs are not allways white, but can sometimes be pale green/blue <br>
      - Ducks are so vigilant, that they can sleep with one eye open <br>
      - Drakes will lose all their flight feather during molting for about a month. During this time, they are completley flightless, and will be more vulnerable<br>
      - Female ducks are more vocal than drakes <br>
      - Ducklings grow up very fast. They will grow about 3 times as big <br>
      - If there are more males than females in a flock, males will often fight with each other, and harass the females in order to mate with her <br>
      - duckling have an egg tooth which helps them to break out of the shell. The tooth falls off soon after hetching <br>
      - Large waterfowl like geese and swan may attack humans if they feel threatened <br>
      - Did you know a bird's body is warmer than ours. It is around 105°F
      - Eggs can "breath" through their egg shell pores. Thats is why ventilation is important in an incubator.<br>
      - The embryo actually comes to life in the hen's body. After it is layed, there can a break of up to 1 week until the development can resume from incubation.<br>
      - Eggs need to reach around 100°F in order to healthily develop. If it is warmer, then they will develop quickly and might die. If they are cooler, they will develop slowley, and have deformations, and probably die. <br>
      - Adult ducks have oil glands, from which they spread oil all over their bodies which help them to float in water<br>
      - Ducks can eat grains like rice or quinoa. They can also eat snacks with out any oil, salt, or sugar, like cheerios<br>
